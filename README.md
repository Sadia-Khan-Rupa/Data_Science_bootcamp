The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that your work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.
●	The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
●	The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
Your analytical and business skills are needed to provide clarity in the following aspects:
●	How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
●	What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
●	How many products are being discounted?
●	How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
●	How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
●	How could data collection be improved?
